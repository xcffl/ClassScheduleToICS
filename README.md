# ClassScheduleToICS

A **WebExtension** to export your class schedule as an ICS file which can be imported into external calenders.

Theoretically, it should work on any system powered by the same software (Oracle Peoplesoft, I suspect), but I currently limit the functionality to CUHKSZ (and CUHK) in the manifest file so the script doesn't run on all websites.

And now, CUHK is also supported.
